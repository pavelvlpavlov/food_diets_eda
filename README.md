# Longitudinal Exploration of Inflation, Healthy Diet Affordability and Food  Prices Across (Low- and Middle Income) Countries

## Overview
The objective of the project was to explore and analyze the dynamics of consumer price inflation, food prices and the share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet. 
The examination of the relationship between the variables provided initial insights and suggestions about potential patterns, which can be used to make informed decisions to guide further research. 

## Data Sources  
Three main data sources were used for this analysis. The data on consumer price inflation was sourced from the World Bank, processed by Our World in Data. Food prices data was sourced from the World Food Programme. Data on the share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet is sourced from FAO and World Bank, with minor processing by Our World in Data.

## Data Analysis Approach 
A combination of descriptive statistics, and data visualization was employed to analyze the data. Key analytical methods include data cleaning, EDA, and trend analysis. Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and Tableau were used for data manipulation and analysis.
